            A number of talented artists are using video games not just as a
            method of telling stories, but as an environment to break
            viewers—and players—out of the “magic circle.”.

            As I wandered through the exhibition Difference Machines: Technology
            and Identity in Contemporary Art, my mind felt like it had been hit
            by several lightning strikes. This exhibition, currently at
            Chicago’s Wrightwood 659 gallery, showcases the work of 17 artists
            who have been working in digital spaces for decades, focusing on how
            the digital world has impacted our collective sense of identities,
            from race and gender to the surveillance state
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            But what struck me were the artists using video games in their work.
            For decades, debates have raged over the role of video games in
            society: Are they art? Are they dangerous? Meanwhile, artists have
            been using video games in their work. Some artists create actual
            video games; others record films within a video game, creating
            movies called machinima.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            Various artists have staged artistic interventions within games, and
            others still have used video game references in their art. And then
            there is the whole genre of fan art. And of course, there are video
            games that are art themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            However, it has taken the art establishment some time to catch up.
            Tina Rivers Ryan, curator of the exhibition and the Buffalo AKG Art
            Museum, explains by email that for digital art as well as video game
            art, “the art world continues to struggle with finding the aesthetic
            or cultural value (let alone market value) in digital art more
            broadly.” There are challenges with displaying video game art since
            “you have to consider questions that don’t come up with traditional
            artwork: What’s the appropriate scale for the work? Should the
            experience be individual or collective, private, or public?” Ryan
            says.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            Slowly but surely, some institutions are starting to recognize the
            artistic value of video games. Notably, the Museum of Modern Art in
            New York has had at least two exhibitions (including the 2022-2023
            exhibition Never Alone) on video games and began acquiring games in
            its collection in 2012, focusing on the design aspect. It has 36
            video games in its archives and is aiming to get 40.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            So the jury is in. Video games can be art. The better question now
            is how contemporary artists can and are using video games in their
            work.

          <h2 class="p1">In and Out of Your Comfort Zone</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            A.M. Darke, exhibiting artist and assistant professor of art and
            design for games and playable media at UC Santa Cruz, explains that
            one of the powerful aspects of video games is that they “invest you
            as a participant and an agent in those stories.” You don’t just
            witness or consume games, especially interactive ones. You actively
            make choices in the game.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            Darke plays with the “magic circle” of games in his art. The magic
            circle is a safe container where “certain things can happen that do
            not impact you.” For instance, if you see a friend play Grand Theft
            Auto, you don’t assume they will kill people and steal cars in the
            real world. “But I design pieces that intentionally break the magic
            circles, so that the actions you take in the game, the experiences,
            [the knowledge and perspectives] you're confronted with, is
            something that remains with you.”
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            Darke created the online two-player game called Ye or Nay? which
            takes a page from the board game Guess Who, but where all the cards
            are Black male celebrities (including several different images of
            Kanye West over his career). Players communicate via in-game chat to
            ask questions. Darke wanted to explore Black masculinity and Black
            celebrity as well as force players to describe and categorize Black
            celebrities in a way “that parallels how databases and algorithms
            identify, track, and discriminate against Black people and other
            marginalized groups.”
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            With Ye or Nay? that experience can take one outside of their
            comfort zone. “The experience of viewing these Black men, and
            describing them and communicating with another person,” Darke says,
            “you become aware [of how] you've externalized an internal automatic
            process of categorization, judgment, and description.” While
            playing, you become hyper aware of how you talk to another person,
            whether they are in your community or outside, he notes.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            In particular, Darke notes that while watching Black folks play the
            game, he notices a level of comfort and almost giddiness. The piece
            centers Blackness and allows players to both celebrate and criticize
            Black culture, Darke points out. But what may be comforting for some
            may have the opposite effect for others, depending on where the
            player stands within or outside of the community.

          <h2 class="p1">Medium as the Message</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            While artists like A.M. Darke make interactive video games that
            people can play in the gallery or online, other artists take a
            different approach by using popular video games as a canvas for
            their work.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            Using these insights, Fuentes’ team has created the FIZZeyeRobot, a
            machine that pours and measures foam lifespan, as well as gas
            released. AI software predicts how this affects flavor compound
            release, and in turn, how potentially palatable the drink will be.
          </p>
          <p class="p1">
            Machinima—movies “filmed” within a game environment—might use any
            game or game world as their setting, from Second Life to Red Dead
            Redemption. There were even Machinima film festivals in the 2000s,
            and in 2016, Warner Brothers bought Machinima Inc., a popular
            multiplatform online entertainment network on YouTube, for about
            $100 million. (The company closed it in 2019.)
          </p>
          <img src="/assets/img/trang21.webp" alt="" />
          <p class="p1">
            Despite the collapse of Machinima Inc., artists have continued
            making films in games and exhibiting them at film festivals and
            other artistic spaces. Skawennati, also known by her Mohawk name,
            Kanien’kehá:ka, is a visual artist with an exhibit at the Difference
            Machines show. She describes machinima as “telling a story that
            might make you feel like you're in a video game, or just help you to
            recall the feelings you have in a video game.” It’s more akin to
            film than other video game pieces like A.M. Darke’s Ye or Nay?.
          </p>
          <!-- <img src="/assets/img/sec3.webp" alt="" /> -->
          <p class="p1">
            Skawennati creates machinima because she wants “to depict Indigenous
            people in the future, and I wanted to use a futuristic medium.” She
            uses Second Life because it “felt like the right medium for the
            message,” she explains. Characters can fly and telepathically send
            each other thoughts in architecturally improbable places.

            Her piece in the exhibition, 2017’s She Falls for Ages, is a
            retelling of the Iroquois creation story where the Sky Woman falls
            to earth from space. In an exhibition interview, she explained that
            she chose to make the sky pink and skin colors a rainbow of colors,
            “I really wanted to see what a post-race society could look like.”
